	<p><em>Flat Hunting</em><br />
<br>
	Some of you may have already found a place to live in Germany, but if you haven't - don't panic! In some towns, especially where there are lots of students looking for accomodation, finding a place to live can take a lot of time and effort. I only found my first flat less than a month before I moved in, but if you can it helps to sort this as early as possible - both for practical reasons as well as for peace of mind!<br/><br>
	The best websites for this are:</br>
	<url="www.wg-gesucht.de/">WG Gesucht <br/>
<br>
	You can either search for available flats using the filters given, or create your own advert allowing flat owners to contact you. 
<br><br>
* <em> WG-Gesucht is generally safe, but do be careful. Make sure you let someone know if you are visiting a flat alone, and speak to the person before to make sure they are who they say they are. Pictures of the flat are always good too! </em>*
