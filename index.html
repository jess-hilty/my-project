    About 
    </h2> 
    
    <p>
      Having just returned from my year abroad in Germany, I know how difficult it can be to get started in a place you don't know without a lot of help or support.
<br/>
<br/>
      This website aims to give you advice for when you first arrive in Germany, as well as some fun things to do once you've settled in and useful contacts it's good to know about!

      Please feel free to use the 'Share your experience' button to share any of your own tips if you're currently on our have recently returned from a year abroad!
