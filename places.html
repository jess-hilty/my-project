     One of the best things about being in Germany on your year abroad is you get to experience the traditional German Christmas markets! <br><br>
     These open in late November, and sell a variety of German crafts, jewellery, etc., making it a great opportunity to do some Christmas shopping. <br><br>
     There is also some amazing food - be sure to try a (1/2 meter!) Fleischspiess, Flammlachs and of course some Gluhwein. <br><br>
      <strong>Karneval</strong><br>

     Traditionally, the "fifth season" (carnival season) is declared open at 11 minutes past 11 on the 11th of the 11th month November. The Carnival spirit is then temporarily suspended during the Advent and Christmas period. <br><br>
     For 6 days in February, the streets of Cologne are full of people in fancy dress in a huge city-wide street party. It's a lot of fun and definitely something you should experience if you're living in Cologne/nearby! <br><br>
     The important 2016 dates are: <br><br>
     - Weiberfastnacht, Thurs 4th February <br><br>
     - Rosenmontag, Monday 8th February <br><br>
     - Aschermittwoch, Wednesday 10th February <br><br>

     There's a great selection of places if you want to do some shopping in Dusseldorf. <br><br>
     One of the most famous parts of the city is the Koenigsallee (also known as 'the Ko' - a tree lined avenue filled with high-end shops and cafes. The shops here are mainly designer brands (such as Chanel, Luis Vuitton, etc.) but there's also a great H&M and American Apparel if your Erasmus grant doesn't cover those! <br><br>
      If you're looking for more high street brands then a 5 minute walk away you'll find the Altstadt, which is full of great shops.
     <br><br>
      <strong>Going out</strong><br>

       <br><br>
     As well as being great for shopping, in the evening the Altstadt is a great place to go for a drink or to go out with friends. <br><br>
     Bolkerstrasse is full of bars selling the traditional Altbier, while Ratingerstrasse is also popular on Wednesday nights. Bars such as Papagayo and Anaconda are popular, as well as Schloesser if you want a club rather than a bar. <br><br>
